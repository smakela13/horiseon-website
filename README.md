The HTML and CSS were reviewed and refactored to make the HTML and CSS semantic, cleaner, and more concise. Accessibility was brought up to standard. Comments were added to bring awareness to the changes made.

## Installation

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate in your browser to your GitHub repository and then navigate into your repository's `Settings` tab on the right side of the repository's page.

4. From the settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled `Source`, select that you would like to use the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (For example, if your GitHub username is `lernantino` and the project is `css-demo-site`, your URL would be `lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site`)
